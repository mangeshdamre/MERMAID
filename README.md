This tutorial introduces Coarse-grained simulation of membrane protein in presence of different concentrations of membrane lipids. The systematic workflow in this server is used to prepare initial coarse-grained system to run CG simulations. The MERMAID web server is used not only to run CG simulation but also it helps to generate the input files that can be downloaded at any moment of time to run locally by user. At the end of the tutorial, the user can also analyze the coarse-grained simulation trajectories. Let us go through MERMAID web server step by step. Detailed MERMAID workflow can be found **<a href="https://github.com/mangeshdamre/MERMAID/blob/main/Images/Detailed-workflow.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>**.

## System preparation

### Submit membrane protein structure
The prepation of Martini coarse-grained system is very easy with the help of MERMAID web server. User should write the project name in the given area which will be used in future to search the finished CGMD simulation. User have three possibilities to submit protein structure. The users can either upload their own membrane protein structure or can write the PDB ID in the given area which will retrive the protein structure either from **<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4UC1" target="_blank">RCSB</a>**  database or from **<a href=https://opm.phar.umich.edu/proteins/2750" target="_blank">OPM</a>**  database to the MERMAID server. On submission of protein structure to MERMAID, user will be redirect to molecular dynamics parameter page.
