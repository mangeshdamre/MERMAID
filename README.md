This tutorial introduces Coarse-grained simulation of membrane protein in presence of different concentrations of membrane lipids. The systematic workflow in this server is used to prepare initial coarse-grained system to run CG simulations. The MERMAID web server is used not only to run CG simulation but also it helps to generate the input files that can be downloaded at any moment of time to run locally by user. At the end of the tutorial, the user can also analyze the coarse-grained simulation trajectories. Let us go through MERMAID web server step by step. Detailed MERMAID workflow can be found here.
